# JS Personal Project: Cake-Man Game

## Background
Cake-Man is a different version of Pac-Man which originally released at 1980. In my version, ghosts have same behaviour, around 50% of the time they directly chase Cakeman. If they cant move to the Cakeman direction, the ghosts check adjacent positions and select a random move. 

## Instructions to Play Cake-Man
The player control cakeman using only arrow keys: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The player should eat all the dots while avoiding ghosts. There is a fixed timer on the upper right, 120 seconds to finish. Timer starts when the player push any controlling buttons.
